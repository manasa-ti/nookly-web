# This .gitignore is for the nookly-web repository
# It negates the parent repository's ignore rule for this directory

# Allow all files in this directory (web build output)
# The parent repo ignores /build/, but this repo needs to track these files
*

# But then un-ignore everything (negate the ignore)
